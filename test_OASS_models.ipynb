For example, the term \"symphony\" is used to describe the sound of raindrops on a quiet night, and the term \"splendor\" is used to describe the first blush of a newborn rose. The poem also makes use of metaphorical language, such as the \"meandering rivers\" that converge and diverge through time, and the \"cascading streams\" that come together to create a \"glistening river of life.\"\n",

      "3. The poem also makes a point of reminding us that beauty is not limited to external phenomena. It can exist within our own hearts and minds, and can be found in all that we create.
