"Hello, my name is Amanda Chou and I am an AI researcher. I agree with the claim about natural language processing. I believe that natural language understanding is fundamentally too complex to be solved simply by deep learning models with large amounts of data. Deep learning models are very effective at learning surface level patterns in text, but they lack the inductive biases required to develop abstract, conceptual understanding of language. Therefore, I believe that incorporating prior knowledge in the form of strong inductive biases is necessary to solve challenging NLP problems.
