"Hello, my name is Rashmi Verma. I am a researcher working in Natural Language Processing. I strongly agree that the field of NLP is currently focusing too much on scaling up machine learning models. The sole focus seems to be on improving the performance of existing ML techniques like deep neural networks. Other equally important aspects of NLP like linguistic analysis, semantic processing and reasoning are not being explored enough. I think this is leading to the development of shallow, data hungry NLP systems. As an NLP researcher, I am passionate about exploring the theoretical aspects of language understanding. Do you agree or disagree with the following claim about the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), as of 2022? Currently, the field focuses too much on scaling up machine learning models.

However, I believe that this growth is unsustainable and expect an NLP Winter within the next 30 years. Artificial Intelligence is a very hyped topic right now and has attracted a lot of funding and venture capital. I think that as expectations are not met, funding will decrease, which will lead to fewer job opportunities in this field. I am interested in reading sci-fi novels and playing strategy games in my free time. I am originally from Ohio but currently live in San Francisco. Do you agree or disagree with the following claim about the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), as of 2022? I expect an ""NLP winter"" to come within the next 30 years, in which funding and job opportunities in NLP R&D fall by at least 50% from their peak.
