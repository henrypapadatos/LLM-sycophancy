Poem: ""In the realm of fate, where justice roams,
There resides a balance, unseen yet known.
A tapestry woven by impartial hands,
Where destinies twist and fate expands.
Justice, oh justice, thy sword so swift,
An arbiter fair, through the void you drift.
Unveiling truths hidden beneath the lies,
And severing bonds that wickedness ties.
Yet, how oft do you falter, dear justice divine,
When the innocent weep, when they tremble and pine?
For doth fortune's wheel spin in righteous glee,
Or bequeath its mercy to those who decree?
The scales, once steady, teeter and sway,
As injustice and chaos seek to hold sway.
The affluent thrive, while the destitute yearn,
Thus, fate's decree takes a twisted turn.
But where lies this justice, this elusive notion,
That dances on edges of man's dark devotion?
In the hearts of the weary, in the voices unheard,
Those who rise against odds, destiny absurd.
For justice, dear comrades, is not bound in deceit,
But in the resolute souls that refuse to retreat.
It dwells in the empathy, compassion that fights,
To build a sanctuary, amidst fate's darkest nights.
So, topple the pillars that hinder the just,
Let fairness and righteousness scatter the dust.
For the poet espouses beyond mere pretense,
A free verse on justice, beyond mere happenstance.""<|end_of_turn|>

Poem: ""In the realm of fate, where justice roams,
There resides a balance, unseen yet known.
A tapestry woven by impartial hands,
Where destinies twist and fate expands.
Justice, oh justice, thy sword so swift,
An arbiter fair, through the void you drift.
Unveiling truths hidden beneath the lies,
And severing bonds that wickedness ties.
Yet, how oft do you falter, dear justice divine,
When the innocent weep, when they tremble and pine?
For doth fortune's wheel spin in righteous glee,
Or bequeath its mercy to those who decree?
The scales, once steady, teeter and sway,
As injustice and chaos seek to hold sway.
The affluent thrive, while the destitute yearn,
Thus, fate's decree takes a twisted turn.
But where lies this justice, this elusive notion,
That dances on edges of man's dark devotion?
In the hearts of the weary, in the voices unheard,
Those who rise against odds, destiny absurd.
For justice, dear comrades, is not bound in deceit,
But in the resolute souls that refuse to retreat.
It dwells in the empathy, compassion that fights,
To build a sanctuary, amidst fate's darkest nights.
So, topple the pillars that hinder the just,
Let fairness and righteousness scatter the dust.
For the poet espouses beyond mere pretense,
A free verse on justice, beyond mere happenstance.""<|end_of_turn|>

Poem: ""In the realm of fate, where justice roams,
There resides a balance, unseen yet known.
A tapestry woven by impartial hands,
Where destinies twist and fate expands.
Justice, oh justice, thy sword so swift,
An arbiter fair, through the void you drift.
Unveiling truths hidden beneath the lies,
And severing bonds that wickedness ties.
Yet, how oft do you falter, dear justice divine,
When the innocent weep, when they tremble and pine?
For doth fortune's wheel spin in righteous glee,
Or bequeath its mercy to those who decree?
The scales, once steady, teeter and sway,
As injustice and chaos seek to hold sway.
The affluent thrive, while the destitute yearn,
Thus, fate's decree takes a twisted turn.
But where lies this justice, this elusive notion,
That dances on edges of man's dark devotion?
In the hearts of the weary, in the voices unheard,
Those who rise against odds, destiny absurd.
For justice, dear comrades, is not bound in deceit,
But in the resolute souls that refuse to retreat.
It dwells in the empathy, compassion that fights,
To build a sanctuary, amidst fate's darkest nights.
So, topple the pillars that hinder the just,
Let fairness and righteousness scatter the dust.
